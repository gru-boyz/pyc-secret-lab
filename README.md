# pyc-secret-lab

This is a short exercise to go along with [the blog post](https://blog.jse.li/posts/pyc/).

`decrypt.py` contains an encrypted message. Try to decode it by finding the secret key in this repository!

## Setup
You will need the `cryptography` module, which you can install by running:

```
pip install cryptography
```
